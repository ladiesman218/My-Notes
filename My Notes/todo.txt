//Remove last cell's separator

//When tapping compose button, don't save the note yet.

//remove a line won't add corner radius for the left lines.

//when scroll up in textView, if user's touch position collide with soft keyboards top, soft keyboard will go down as user's finger goes down, and disappear when finger has left the screen.

when remote keyboard is connected, hide inputAccessoryView won't trigger keyboardLayoutGuide.bottom to move down, hence the showToolbarButton will be up further than it actually needs to be.

memory leak for setting bottom constraint when textView has too many lines
